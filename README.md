This code uses RL to train the modulator to generate as short laser impuse as possible. For now, I am not sure what we are doing, so more description will appear here soon.

## Folder structure:

	 - code by **Alicja KwaÅ›ny** for  communication with devices
	 - a simple lients that queries the server and ask which funcion should be executed
- `laser_train`: main folder of the repo, that contains the environment and (....) we will see :>
